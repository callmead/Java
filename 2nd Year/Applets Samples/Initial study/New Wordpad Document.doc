\b\i Introduction\par
\pard\sl480\slmult1\qj\b0\i0 The purpose of this project is to analysis; design and develop a software for Students performance of a Daffodil Institute of IT as a practical project of the AIDCS final year exam held in september 2004. In designing and developing this project Object Oriented Technique is used. As a modeling tool UML is practice here considering that UML is the emerging modeling tool in now-a-days also used DFD, ERD, ELH. The programming language used here JAVA and database used is access. We believe all this combination has built a foundation in our learning process and obviously We have gathered some experiences for development of a software.\par
This students result processing system  is required by an Institute where I Study.  They have numbers of computers, printers, network equipments and other peripherals used by considerable number of users. All the instruments they posses need to be maintained.\par
This application is developed by java which execute on all environment.\par

    \par
 \b0\f0 Initial study is mainly concerned with identifying the scope of the project, its objectives, and what product it must produce before it can be considered complete. The main purpose of initial study is to asses the feasibility so the project. It is very important to define the problem in user terms as precisely as possible.\par
\par
A system means any collection of component elements or procedure that work together to perform a task. System can be computerized or manual. Whatever the system is, every system has some complexity. And if the system is manual system, more complexity occurs. A manual system needs more manpower, time, spaces and expenses of money. As a result, manual system is just abuse of manpower, misuse of money, wastage of time and spaces. \par
\pard Because of the widespread use and availability of computers, it is essential to \par
\par
develop the manual system to a new system, which will save our time, money \par
\par
and spaces and reduce the manpower making them skilled.\b\f1\par

\par
were aware of it. Any group can complete a project based on any topic \par
\par
through any computer related language. This project completed based \par
\par
on application. And it is implemented through a IT \par
\par
related Institute and the documentation is based on it.\par

country its popularity is rapid growing.\par

It has thought of working on something new and which is at the same \par
\par
demanding too. So we have chosen to build up a software which can be \par
\par
managed by DIIT. Which will provide information of student result, the best service.\par

\pard\sl480\slmult1\qj\b  Background of DIIT: \b0 Daffodil Institute of Information Technology (DIIT) is the leading NCC education-training provider in Bangladesh\super\b\i 1, 2\nosupersub\b0 . \i0 DIIT is a sister concern of Daffodil Computers. The history of Daffodil started with one-man effort of Md. Sabur Khan, one of the successful entrepreneurs of Bangladesh. In 1990, when he started his computer business and with the very quick and marvelous growth in that business, he found the IT training opportunity in Bangladesh.\par
In the beginning he started with IT short programs for individual and corporate organizations. After achieving great success in normal training Daffodil got the opportunity to start the NCC education and training with the name of DIIT as an affiliated institute of NCC (UK).\par
NCC Education Service is the world\rquote s leading independent provider of IT Training and Education Programs. NCC Education operates with over 400 training and Education providers in over 38 countries worldwide and now, with over 150,000 students is assessed to NCC standards each year. Universities in UK, USA, AUSTRALIA, Canada and New Zealand recognize not only by other NCC centers worldwide, but NCC qualifications also\super\b\i 3\nosupersub\b0\i0 .\par
The first batch of DIIT started with only seven students and fifteen computers in March 1997. Today DIIT has the latest computer lab with more than eighty computers. Due to continue effort the number of student is increasing tremendously. But the student result processing system in manually.\par
\pard\sl480\slmult1 Note: An Increasing Bar Chart is in Appendix-A\par

\par
\pard\sl480\slmult1\qj\nosupersub\b  Problems\par
\b0 At present we as students go through lot of problems because everything we do is through manual process and we don\rquote t have any developed system rather than to keep record on paper. The problems we face everyday are:\par
\par
\b Time Consuming Process & cost ineffective:\b0  It is proven that modern technology can save time and money at the same giving a consume maximum satisfaction of the product and services.\par
\b Intensive paper work:\b0  Pilling up paper is no longer today\rquote s technology so we need to keep our institution up to date with the present world.\par
\b Dependent too much on human ability\b0 : Always human ability is susceptible to error, which can have a negative effect on our performance. \par
\b Instant Access:\b0  Student can\rquote t get class schedule, examination schedule , get result on time or even lesson plan on time.\par
\b Real time Database:\b0  Now it takes more than expected time to collect the feedback on our exams. But if you could establish a good system which can keep track on our individual database for real time use.\par
\b Lack of co-ordination:\b0  Lack of co-ordination within the faculty members is visible because of poor and outdated communication system. \par
The proposed system will solve some of these above problems. , which we are going to design, will help a teacher and student to get any required information and be ready in advance. All a student needs is a valid ID of his/her own. They also find examinations mark and selection result privious class test. Guardians can collect information about the performance of his/her child.\par
\par
\b  Needs\par
\b0 When the thought \ldblquote Why do we need a software?\rdblquote  crosses our mind with the problem we are facing now without it. The software is the  fastest calculative media, which help an individual in getting on time real information. The importance of developing is an innovative approach itself, clearly displaying the knowledge that we learned through lectures. Developing a software  is not only displaying my adherence to our specialized area but also it will enhance our ability for the new area. So we will pay attention on the following things while designing the software.\par

\pard\sl480\slmult1\qj Who is going to benefit from the software?  \par
 \b Current Student:\b0  They will be benefited most. For example: a student needs to know the privious result records so he/she can easily know the result by using this software. and he can also know the teachers,s  name who give their marks. He can also know their attendance amount. \par
\b Teacher:\b0  This software is developed mainly for teaching department. So this will be very help for the teachers.The teachers can store the student's records. And by using this records the teachers can easily create various types of  result. \par

\pard\sl480\slmult1\qj 3: Library In charge\par
\b0 Every institute that has a library should have a library in-charge. DIIT also have a rich library but there is no specific post for a library in-charge at present. So the duty of a library in-charge is maintained by a senior lecturer, which is very sincere to his work. There are two sub-ordinates of him, the librarian and the assistant librarian. The library in-charge collects a weekly report from the librarian, which contains all the information about the library. It is also his responsibility to collect comments of both the teachers and students about the library. There is a budget of 50,000 for buying books for the library each year. To buy new books the library in-charge goes through the top management to take necessary steps. He has to submit a monthly report to the top management about all the information of the library.\par

\b0 After completing the initial study it seems that the current system needs improvement. We received all kinds of help from every one and the working environment was very friendly. It makes sense that if we work with DIIT Personnel management,  it is possible to develop the current result processing system to computerized system. Now, we should go for feasibility study.\par
