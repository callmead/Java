Today we will Learn about File Reading. With Reading a Cheracter at a Time

Normally we do two things

File I/O

Rading we use these classes
a) FIle
b) File Reader
c) Buffered Reader
 
Writing
a) File
b) File Writer
c) Buffered Writer

See File Class in API

WE will use this

File(String pathname) 
Creates a new File instance by converting the given pathname string into an abstract pathname.

e.g File f = mew FIle("c:\\input.txt"); \\ Two Times 


Example 1
YOur FIle input.txt in C drive root contains text

This is First Read
This is First Read

-----------------
And Your Java FIle is this

import java.io.*;
public class ReadingFile
{
	public static void main (String a[]) throws IOException
	{
		File f = new File("c:\\input.txt");//See API, File
		FileReader fr = new FileReader(f); //See API, FileReader This Methods REads Cheracter one by one
		char c = (char) fr.read(); //Reading Cheracter and then Converting the Ascii VAlue to Cheracter
		System.out.println(c);
	}
}
-------------------------------------------------------
The OutPut will be only T The Very First Cheracter Only now change the Coding in this way
and see

import java.io.*;
public class ReadingFile
{
	public static void main (String a[]) throws IOException
	{
		File f = new File("c:\\input.txt");//See API, File
		FileReader fr = new FileReader(f); //See API, FileReader This Methods REads Cheracter one by one
		for(int i = 1; i<=100;i++) //Change 100 with 1000 and see what happens
		{
			char c = (char) fr.read();
			System.out.print(c);
		}
	}
}
---------------------------------------------------------
If we dont use Buffer Reader then this This Reader only reads one cheracter and returns its 
Ascii value and we have to Convert it to Cheracter. So we need to Read every next Cheracter 
untill then Cheracters end but we need to know how many cheracters are available.
Therefore we need BufferReader but there is another way for this method also see Example

import java.io.*;
public class ReadingFile
{
	public static void main (String a[]) throws IOException
	{
		File f = new File("c:\\input.txt");//See API, File
		FileReader fr = new FileReader(f); //See API, FileReader This Methods REads Cheracter one by one

		for(int i = 1; i<=1000;i++)
		{
			int b = fr.read();
			char c = (char)b;
			//char c = (char) fr.read();
			if (b ==-1)
			{
				System.out.println("End of File");
				break;
			}
			else
			{
				System.out.print(c);
			}
		}
	}
}
-----------------------------------
But we still dont know how many cheracters are available in the FIle(we are using i<=1000)
so we Use a While Loop see the Below Example

import java.io.*;
public class ReadingFile
{
	public static void main (String a[]) throws IOException
	{
		File f = new File("c:\\input.txt");//See API, File
		FileReader fr = new FileReader(f); //See API, FileReader This Methods REads Cheracter one by one

		//for(int i = 1; i<=1000;i++)
		//{
int b;
			while ((b=fr.read()) != -1)
			{

				System.out.print((char)b);
			}
			System.out.println("End Of File....!");
		//}
	}
}
-----------------------------------
MAster Piece REads all kinds of Files like *.bat,*.sys, even *.doc but not Readable for Humans
The Path is given in Input Box like c:\autoexec.bat

import javax.swing.*;
import java.io.*;
public class ReadingDllFile
{
	public static void main (String a[]) throws IOException
	{
		String path = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Enter File Path with File Name e.g c:\\Autoexec.bat");
		File f = new File(path);//See API, File

		FileReader fr = new FileReader(f); //See API, FileReader This Methods REads Cheracter one by one
		int b;
		while ((b=fr.read()) != -1)
		{
			System.out.print((char)b);
		}
		System.out.println("End Of File....!");
		System.exit(0);

	}
}
----------------------------------------
MAster PIece Which Insures if the File is Present or not and then Gives its TExt
import javax.swing.*;
import java.io.*;
public class ReadingDllFile
{
	public static void main (String a[]) throws IOException
	{
		String path = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Enter File Path with File Name e.g c:\\Autoexec.bat");
		File f = new File(path);//See API, File
		if(f.exists())
		{
			FileReader fr = new FileReader(f); //See API, FileReader This Methods REads Cheracter one by one
			int b;
			while ((b=fr.read()) != -1)
			{
				System.out.print((char)b);
			}
			System.out.println("End Of File....!");
			System.exit(0);
		}
		//System.out.println("exists");
		else
		JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"The File Does not Exists on This Path "+path);
		System.exit(0);

	}//m,ain
}
