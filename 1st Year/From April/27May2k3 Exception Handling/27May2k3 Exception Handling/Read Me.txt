There are several Packages we can use but the most important are

import java.lang.*; //Import Everything from Java Folder and lang is Sub Folder
When you import this then not all the classes are imported only those which we have used 
in our program.

There are several Sub classes of this Package but we dont need to Imporrt his Package
because by default his is Imported.


import java.io.*; 
All the File, BR, BW, These classes are inside this.

javax.swing.*;
All the Components which can be used in Forms(Frames) are insode Swing Package.


How to compile Java Files from DOS (JDK)
first 
Set Path=c:\jdk1.3\bin
Then goto File Dir and then 
Javac test.java           //this will produce a class file and for running program we use 
class file.

java test //Run it

Try Catch Exception
Run this Code

public class test
{
	public static void main(String a[])
	{
		int x=3/0;
	
		System.out.print(x);
	}//main
}//class

The Error will be "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmaticException: /by zero
at test.main(test.java:5)

Now we use Try Catch Exception Handling Method

public class test
{
	public static void main(String a[])
	{
		int x=0;
		try
		{
			x=3/0;
		}
		catch(ArithmeticException v)
		{
			System.out.println("Exception Occured....!");
		}

		System.out.println(x);
		System.out.println("Program Crashed....");
	}//main
}//class

Now as in the Above code we know which Exception is Ocured, but we can also use more 
then one Catch like this

public class test
{
	public static void main(String a[])
	{
		int x=0;
		try
		{
			x=3/0;
		}
		catch(ArithmeticException v)
		{
			System.out.println("ArithmeticException Occured....!");
		}

		catch(FileNotFoundException v)
		{
			System.out.println("FileNotFoundException Occured....!");
		}

		System.out.println(x);
		System.out.println("Program Crashed....");
	}//main
}//class

We can also use 2 Exceptions like the coding below but When the First Exception will be
Catch then the second one will not execute.

import java.io.*;
public class test
{
	public static void main(String a[])
	{
		int x=0;
		File f;

		try
		{
			x=3/0;
			f=new File("c:\\test.txt");
			FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
		}
		catch(ArithmeticException v)
		{
			System.out.println("ArithmeticException Occured....!");
		}

		catch(FileNotFoundException v)
		{
			System.out.println("FileNotFoundException Occured....!");
		}

		System.out.println(x);
		System.out.println("Program Crashed....");
	}//main
}//class

But if we use this way then the Second one will be Caught

import java.io.*;
public class test
{
	public static void main(String a[])
	{
		int x=0;
		File f;

		try
		{
			//x=3/0;
			f=new File("c:\\test.txt");
			FileReader fr = new FileReader(f);
		}
		catch(ArithmeticException v)
		{
			System.out.println("ArithmeticException Occured....!");
		}

		catch(FileNotFoundException v)
		{
			System.out.println("FileNotFoundException Occured....!");
		}

		System.out.println(x);
		System.out.println("Program Crashed....");
	}//main
}//class

So this is a Big Head acheq

This is all about Exception Handeling if you know what type of Exception is Occuring
then you can catch it and save the program from Abnormal Crash.




How to get all Java Codes of Packages
Set Path=c:\jdk1.3\bin
java xvf src.jar

x means Extract
for making Jar 
java cvf a.jar a.class (a.jar is the new jar file to be created and a.class in the source file)
java cvf a.jar *.* (from all files in the Current Dir make Jar)

Extracting Jar file ....
java xvf a.jar
